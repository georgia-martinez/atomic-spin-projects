# Atomic Spin Projects

As part of my job as a Software Developer & Consultant at Atomic Object, I contribute to Atomic's blog, [Atomic Spin](https://spin.atomicobject.com/), by writing blog posts about programming topics I find interesting.

This repository contains all the code for any tutorials I have written about in my Spin posts. You can read through all the Spin posts I've written [here](https://spin.atomicobject.com/author/georgia-martinez/).
